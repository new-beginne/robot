## ‚ú® Why This Robot?

Setting up a new project involves creating a repetitive structure of folders and files. This manual process is tedious, slow, and prone to errors. This robot solves this problem by providing a powerful and forgiving command-line interface that makes project scaffolding a breeze.

## üî• Key Features

- **ü§ñ Interactive Wizard:** No need to write complex JSON. The wizard guides you step-by-step through a simple number-based menu.
- **üëÅÔ∏è Live Preview & Edit:** Before a single file is touched, get a beautiful tree preview of your entire planned structure.
- **üí™ Powerful Review Stage:**
  - **Edit with Ease:** Rename, Delete, Copy, and Move any item directly from the preview.
  - **Forgiving Undo:** Made a mistake while editing? **Undo your last change** in the review stage with a single command.
  - **Flexible Workflow:** Forgot to add a file? No problem! **Go back to the wizard**, add more items, and then review the updated structure again.
- **‚è™ 100% Reversible:** The most important feature! If anything goes wrong or you change your mind, a single `--undo` command reverts all changes, leaving your system perfectly clean.
- **üì¶ Zero Dependencies:** A single, self-contained Python script that runs anywhere Python is installed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher.

### Installation
No installation needed! Just clone the repository and run the script.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/new-beginne/robot.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd robot
    ```

## üíª How to Use

### 1. Wizard Mode (Default & Recommended)
This is the easiest and most powerful way to use the tool. Simply run the script (assuming you've renamed it to `robot.py`):
```bash
python3 robot.py
```
The wizard will guide you through creating your project. When you're done, you'll enter the **Review Stage**, where you can modify your structure before execution.

### 2. File Mode (For Automation)
You can also run operations directly from a pre-written JSON file. This is great for automating common project setups.

1.  Create a JSON file (e.g., `my_project.json`):
    ```json
    [
      {
        "operation": "create",
        "mode": "folder",
        "path": "my-new-app/src"
      },
      {
        "operation": "create",
        "mode": "file",
        "path": "my-new-app/src/index.js",
        "content": "console.log('Hello, World!');"
      }
    ]
    ```
2.  Run the robot with the `-i` or `--input` flag:
    ```bash
    python3 robot.py -i my_project.json
    ```

### 3. Undoing Changes
Every time you run the robot, it creates a backup of the operations. To undo the last operation, use the `--undo` flag with the **same input file** that was used to create it.

-   **To undo a wizard-generated operation:**
    ```bash
    python3 robot.py -i instructions/auto_generated.json --undo
    ```

-   **To undo an operation from a custom file:**
    ```bash
    python3 robot.py -i my_project.json --undo
    ```
